        <h1 class="large-font"><b>seasons</b></h1>
        <p>A season is a division of the year based on changes in weather, ecology, and the number of daylight
            hours in a
            given region. On Earth, seasons are the result of the axial parallelism of Earth's tilted orbit
            around the
            Sun.
            In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that
            reaches the
            Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to undergo hibernation or to migrate, and
            plants to be
            dormant.
            Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations, and as such
            there are a
            number of both modern and historical cultures whose number of seasons varies.</p>

        <h1 class="large-font">seasons of the year</h1>
        <p>The four seasons—spring, summer, autumn(fall), and winter—follow one another regularly.<br>
            Each has its own light, temperature, and weather patterns that repeat yearly.</p>

                        The season of the year between winter and summer, lasting from March to June north of the
                        equator,

                        seasons,
                        occurring after spring and before autumn.
                        At or centred on the summer solstice, daylight hours are longest and darkness hours are
                        shortest,
                        with
                        day
                        length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning of
                        summer
                        varies according to
                        climate, tradition, and culture.

                        September,

                        solstice.<span style="font-size: 20px;">called also fall.</span>

                        <span style="font-size: 32px;"> Winter</span> is the coldest and darkest season of the year in
                        polar
                        and temperate climates. It occurs after
                        autumn
                        and before spring. The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is
                        oriented
                        away
                        from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a
                        definition
                        based on weather.
